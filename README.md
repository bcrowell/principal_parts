======================

In this audio recording, you'll hear the first few principal parts of
about 100 of the most common verbs in Homer. If the verb has a
present, a future, and a single aorist, then you'll hear the present,
a few seconds of silence, and then the future and the aorist, along
with an English translation. I don't give the 4th, 5th, or 6th parts,
but if there is a second aorist, I include that. The pronunciation is
I hope a fairly standard US Erasmian, with tonal accents. The basic
idea of this recording is to have something to listen to in the car so
that the forms become familiar. Illustration by Flaxman.

# Pronunciation

The pronunciation is a fairly sandard US Erasmian, with
ω=[o], ο=[ɔ], and υ=[ʊ].
